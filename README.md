# Voice Controlled Lamp With Local Ghanaian Language (TWI) Using tinyML

The Voice Controlled Lamp is an experimental project built to explore and harness the power of tinyML. A machine learning model was trained on a 'good' number of audio data to recognize the local words: 'S)'- TWI equivalent of the English word 'ON' and 'DUM'- TWI equivalent of the English Word 'OFF'. When either of these words is detected, a lamp connected to the Arduino microcontroller is turned ON or OFF. 
It is a quite a challenge for some Ghanaians to interact with technology due to the fact that most technologies are built around English, even in basic forms. This 'mini' project can help people who speak TWI (and can even be extended to other Ghanaian languages) to interact with technology.
